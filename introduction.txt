Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Abel, and I am a dedicated and self-motivated learner with a strong passion for technology and personal growth. Growing up in a single-parent household taught me resilience, responsibility, and the value of working hard for every opportunity. These experiences have shaped my character and pushed me to always aim higher, both academically and personally.

I enjoy exploring new skills, especially in areas like software development, data science, and digital tools that improve everyday life. I believe in continuous learning, helping others, and using technology to solve real problems. This GitHub journey represents my commitment to building my skills, documenting my progress, and creating a better future for myself and those around me.
