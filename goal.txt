In the coming year, I aim to strengthen my academic foundation by improving my technical skills, especially in areas such as programming, data science, and version control using Git and GitHub. I plan to enroll in more online courses, complete hands-on projects, and stay consistent in my studies so I can build a strong portfolio that reflects my progress and abilities.

On a personal level, I want to develop better time-management habits, stay disciplined in my daily routines, and maintain a strong commitment to self-improvement. I also hope to support others in their learning journeys, become more confident in collaborative projects, and take advantage of opportunities that help me grow both personally and professionally.
